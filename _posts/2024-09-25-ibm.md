IBM watsonx.ai next generation enterprise studio for AI builders to train, validate, tune and deploy AI models.
In this hackathon, I used the granite foundation model zero shot prompting to create a chatbot that is able to analyize unstructured business documents, (pdfs).
I used React for frotend and flask for backend, the flask app is connected to the IBM API to process query and responses. The files are preprocessed before sending it to the granite FM.
