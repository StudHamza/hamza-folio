## FM Receiver App – Week 12 and 13 Update

We're coming to an end and these 2 weeks progress we're documenting and fixing small bugs. Week 13s progress was the following topics:

1. Improve Documentations, READMEs in each directory along with mkdocs github page
2. Use soapy SDR source instead of osmocom

---

### Documentation

Its time to wrap things up and document my FM application, I added a README file in each directory that explains the files and function of each directory; making it easier for new contributors to understand the project structure. I also created a mkdocs web page with in depth tutorial that explains each concept that i implemented in the project. 

Check out the github page here [https://studhamza.github.io/GNU-Radio-FM-App/](https://studhamza.github.io/GNU-Radio-FM-App/)

### SOAPY SDR source

The SoapySDR Source block is deprecated, but the `soapy_custom_source` block is not. I updated my code to use `soapy_custom_source` in order to avoid the additional dependencies of the Osmocom library. In addiction, since I am already using the SoapySDR Python bindings to detect connected devices, it made sense to use the `soapy_custom_source` block as well.

I have also noticed that there is no documentation for this block, maybe I need to contribute to the GNU Radio Docs.

## End

Finally, this project has come to an end, there are plenty of suggested improvements that I might work on before the final submission

1. Allow Sample Rate Change
2. Improve FM detection logic
3. Calculate Station strength and display it
