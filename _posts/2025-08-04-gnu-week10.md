## FM Receiver App â€“ Week 10 Update

This week I made progress on the following topics:

1. Fixed toggle issue during scanning
2. Added SDR Config Manager 
3. Mkdocs Server
4. Debugged the Config Manager

### Fixed toggle issue during scanning

Previously, during scanning the toggle of the listen button would switch and it would appear checked when its not really checked, to fix this issue I edited the fm player function to set checkable according to the status of the mute.

```python
    def fm_player(self):
        """Toggle volume on/off"""
        if self.mute: # is muted --> unmute
            self.mute_button.setText("Stop Listening")
            self.mute_button.setChecked(True)
            self.set_mute(False)
        else:   # not muted --> mute
            self.mute_button.setText("Listen")
            self.mute_button.setChecked(False)
            self.set_mute(True)
```

This ensures the listen button is checked only when listening

### SDR Config Manager

The application now allows the user to choose a connected SDR device before proceeding, this avoid stack crash when the app doesnt detect the sdr device
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/gnu_radio/week10/sdr_config.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

It automatically scans for avaliable sdr devices, and gets the serial of the detected device which is later used in the flowgraph as a parameter.

### Mkdocs Server

For the documentation part, I have added a docstring to every function in the main window, I have also added type hints for parameters. I also learned mkdocs to serve a web app on github pages. You can acess the page from here [docs](https://studhamza.github.io/GNU-Radio-FM-App/)
