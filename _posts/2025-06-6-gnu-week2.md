## FM Receiver App – Week 2 Update

This week, I made progress in the following features:

1. Establishing a comprehensive project directory structure  
2. Designing and prototyping the user interface (UI)

---

### 1. Repository Structure Setup

I used python project templates along with AI to helping shape the structure in a clean, scalable format. 

Here's the high-level breakdown:

```
fm-receiver-app/
├── docs/              # Documentation (Installation, Dev Guide, etc.)
├── flowgraphs/        # GNU Radio Companion (.grc) + generated Python
├── src/               # Main application (core logic, GUI, utils)
├── tests/             # Unit and integration tests
├── scripts/           # Dev utilities (build, package, test)
├── examples/          # Sample setups for different SDRs
├── packaging/         # OS-specific distribution configs
├── data/              # Sample recordings and configs
├── README.md, setup.py, requirements.txt, etc.
```

Some key highlights:

- `flowgraphs/` contains `.grc` and autogenerated Python scripts for different receiver modes (basic FM, RDS, etc.).
- `src/fm_receiver/gui/` holds all the GUI components, organized by responsibility (e.g., spectrum, control panel, RDS).
- `core/` contains the interface to GNU Radio, signal processing, and audio handling.
- `utils/` supports tasks like frequency conversions, logging, and file I/O.
- Tests are separated into functional and integration layers to keep development reliable and regression-free.

This structure sets the foundation for long-term maintainability and team collaboration.

### 2. UI Design Progress

After drafting the initial layout with pencil sketches, I moved into high-fidelity Figma mockups and started implementing the first working UI in PyQt5. 

#### Initial Concept Sketch

#### Figma Mockup Preview
This guided the visual hierarchy and layout of the interface.

#### Implemented in PyQt5

Basic layout with spectrum plot and control panel:
- Live FFT display
- Frequency tuning dial
- Play/Stop buttons

#### Spectrum View (FFT)
Integrated `pyqtgraph` to enable real-time signal visualization.

### Tools and Frameworks Used

- GUI Framework: PyQt5  
- Plotting: pyqtgraph  
- Signal Processing: GNU Radio 3.10+  
- Design Tools: Figma for mockups, pencil for fast sketching

### What's Next?

For next week, I'm planning to:

- Develop the the GNU Radio flow graph for FM reception and RDS decoding
- Polish the GUI, settings, advance view and flow graph control
- Attempt to connect the pyhton generated flowgraphs with the frontend
