I'm thrilled to share that I’ve been selected for **Google Summer of Code 2025**! 

As part of this incredible opportunity, I will be working with the **GnuRadio** community on a project that combines signal processing, software-defined radio, and user-focused design: **Developing a user-friendly FM Broadcast Receiver Application with RDS and Spectrum Scanning**.

---

## About the Project

The goal is to build a **plug-and-play FM receiver application** that works across various SDR (Software Defined Radio) hardware. This includes:

- Receiving and decoding FM radio using GnuRadio flowgraphs
- Integrating **RDS (Radio Data System)** to extract metadata like station info and song titles
- Implementing **spectrum scanning** to list active FM channels
- Providing a **debug view** with real-time plots and visualizations
- Supporting **recording** and **multi-stream** listening
- Adding advanced features like **SCA (Subsidiary Communications Authorization)** decoding

The application will be built using **PyQt for the GUI**, and **GnuRadio** for backend signal processing.

## The Bonding Period Plan

Between **May 8 and June 1**, I'm focused on bonding with the GnuRadio community through:

- Participating in Matrix and IRC discussions
- Setting up my dev environment and GitHub repo
- Finalizing architecture and planning UI/UX
- Reviewing relevant codebases like `gr-rds` and `gqrx`
- Gathering feedback from mentors and community members

This period is also about refining project details and ensuring that the scope is both achievable and impactful.

## What's Next?

Starting **June 2**, I’ll begin building the core FM reception and decoding flowgraph using GnuRadio, followed by GUI development and integration. Stay tuned for progress updates, midterm insights, and behind-the-scenes learnings!
